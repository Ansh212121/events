Objective: 
 The goal is to make a website which lists all the events in a specific city [Sydney, Australia]. 
 The events in the city are automatically scraped from event websites in that city, and listed beautifully 
on the website along with their details. 
 When the user clicks on a “GET TICKETS” button, you need to take his email address with an email 
opt, and then redirect him to the original website. 
 The script should run every 24 hours to fetch updated event details.
